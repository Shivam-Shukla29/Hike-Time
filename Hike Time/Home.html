        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.<br>


Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.<br>


The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario. <br>


With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it today.<br>


Here are nine outstanding parallax scrolling examples built with Wix, handpicked for your web design inspiration:<br>



Parallax scrolling examples<br>


01. Mild Design<br><br>


Emilie De Grosbois, a Montreal-based visual artist and the founder of Mild Design, can show us a thing or two about how to make a portfolio. Her own portfolio website strikes visitors with an impressive welcome: a series of intricate fullscreen images displayed in a long scroll.  These are some of the best website images we've seen. <br>


By use of parallax, the transition from one image to the next becomes not only smoother, but it also adds a sense of depth, as if the images gently glide on top of each other.<br><br>
02. Nolan Omura<br><br>


Nolan Omura is a Hawaii-based photographer and videographer specializing in underwater photography. His ingenious take on the parallax scrolling effect adds depth and motion to his already captivating homepage design.<br>


By dividing the page into full-width strips, site visitors are met with exhilarating shots of aquatic life each time they scroll down further. The strips float gently above one another, using a mix of both parallax and reveal scrolling effects.  <br>


Giving the photographs even more movement are minute animations. While these are barely discernible, the website animations - combined with the use of parallax and video - make this page fully come to life.<br><br>
03. Chris Covert<br><br>


Aerospace engineer Chris Covert’s bold resume website is just as professional as it is innovative. The site’s design and interactivity manage to inject much of Chris’ personality into what could have otherwise been a dry list of skills, experience, and education history. <br>


Chris places shots of his printed CV and business card in the center of the screen. Using the reveal scroll effect, the website background images swiftly changes behind them as the visuals stay put, achieving a surprising result. <br>


Paying much attention down to the smallest of details, the website provides a remarkable answer to the question of how to write a resume. It also includes a downloadable PDF document of the CV for potential employers to print out.<br>
